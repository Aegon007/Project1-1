```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Assignment

Please paste the assignment here

## Reading data

Please add R code that reads data here

```{r reading_data, echo=FALSE}

```

## Computation

Please add R code that computes the results

```{r computation, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Results

These are our results:

```{r results, echo=FALSE}
x<-data.frame("GLM"=c(0.1,0.2),"kNNC"=c(0.3,0.4))
rownames(x) <- c("first10","all")
library(knitr)
kable(x)
```
